/*widget component  class capable of setting the damage text on its floating damage widget object.

The reason I wanted this Cplusplus class is simply for one thing, and that's that I'd like a

C plus plus function on this class so that if we create one of these from C plus plus, we can call

that function.

What we do in response to calling it I want to handle on the blueprint side.
